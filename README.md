# Pizza Runner - 8-Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the **Pizza Runner** case study from the **8-Week SQL Challenge** by **Danny's Diner**. In this case study, I analyzed various aspects of pizza orders, including customer preferences, order frequency, runner performance, and ingredient optimization using SQL queries.

## Project Overview

The goal of the **Pizza Runner** case study was to design and execute SQL queries that:
- Analyze pizza orders, tracking customer preferences and order frequency.
- Assess runner performance in terms of efficiency and delivery times.
- Optimize ingredient usage by identifying frequently used pizza toppings and managing inventory.

## Key Features

- **Database Schema**: Designed the database schema with tables for customers, orders, order items, pizzas, and runners.
- **SQL Queries**: Developed optimized SQL queries to generate meaningful insights and answer business-related questions.
- **Metrics Analysis**: Focused on key metrics such as order frequency, runner performance, and ingredient usage.
- **Custom Reports**: Generated customized reports for order item strings, pizza exclusions and extras, and runner performance.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL** (MySQL): Used to design the database schema, write queries, and generate reports.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and hosting the project repository.

## Problem-Solving Skills

This project helped me to:
- Develop complex SQL queries to aggregate and analyze data efficiently.
- Handle dynamic business logic, such as exclusions and extras in pizza orders.
- Optimize queries for large datasets and ensure performance efficiency.
- Gain hands-on experience in solving real-world business problems using SQL.
